# to git push a new file, you had to use git add to tell it there is a new file
#if you just want to add the changes you can git push and it will save the new changes

#! is called shubang
#!/usr/bin/env python3 use this at the beginning of each python file to make them executable
#then you can use ./programname.py to execute the file

#options anf flags start with - in terminal for example $ ls -l is different than using ls

#functions can only be named with characters, numbers and _
#start with a _ to make it hidden

#when creating a test, name it test_ because we'll be using a testing program that recognizes that
#when a function takes no parameters then it is empty parentheses
